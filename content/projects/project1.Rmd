The following ***layout settings*** are made:

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75,

  fig.align = "center"

The following ***packages*** are installed in RStudio:

# Climate change and temperature anomalies

If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined
Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the
Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of
temperature anomalies can be found
here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies I need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between
1951-1980.

I ran the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```



**NOTE:** When using this function, I added two options: `skip` and
`na`:

1.  ***The `skip=1`*** option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so I need to skip one row.

2.  ***`na = "***"`*** option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "\*\*\*". It is good practice to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

3. Once the data is loaded, there is an ***object titled `weather`
in the `Environment` panel***. 



**Side note**: If you cannot see the panel (usually on the
top-right), go to `Tools` \> `Global Options` \> `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of
temperature from the normal (expected). Further, the dataframe is in wide format.





# Cleaning the data

First, I cleaned the data to leave only the relevant ones for the analysis:

- Selected the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset.

- Converted the dataframe from wide to 'long' format, and named the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.



```{r tidyweather}

# Create tidyweather data
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  select(-c("J-D", "D-N", "DJF", "JJA", "MAM", "SON")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = "month", values_to = "delta")
```


- Then, I inspected this dataframe to have three variables now, one each for:
    * year,
    * month, and
    * delta, or temperature deviation.
  





## Plotting Information

For the purpose of the analysis, I needed to plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. 

*To do that, I first needed to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically.*



**NOTE:**
> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; 

> I did so that I can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe`tidyweather`. 

> To actually run this code and knit this document, `eval=FALSE` must be deleted, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**



```{r scatter_plot}

# Set date format tidyweather data
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

# Plot weather anomalies
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )
